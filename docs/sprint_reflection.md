Sprint Reflection

During our one-week sprint we delivered a functional Financial Transactions Summary Tool and demonstrated Agile collaboration.

- What went well: clear roles, branch-per-feature, frequent commits.
- Challenges: inferring categories and signs from inconsistent data.
- What we'd change: add more unit tests and schema discovery early.
